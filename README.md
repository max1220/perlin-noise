Various versions of Perlin noise

This is a collection of various files I have been sprinkling around
the Internet for a couple of decades. It was about time I collected
them in a proper repository.

The functions are in plain C. Porting to C++ is only a matter
of encapsulating this in classes. I have a few of these functions
in that format as well, but I am reluctant to maintain a separate
C++ version. Let me know if this is a problem.
